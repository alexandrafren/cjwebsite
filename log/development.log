Raking in a disclosed $100 million paycheck for the contest, Conor took some time off vacationing in Ibiza, snorkeling out at sea off his yacht, and even accompanied famous fashion icon Donatella Versace to the British Fashion Awards.\n\nMcGregor has appeared absent from training as of late, but since the recent dawn of the new year, McGregor has posted a few pictures to his Instagram page posing with fellow SBG teammate Richie Smullen and head coach of SBG Dublin 24, retired ex UFC fighter, Paddy “The Hooligan” Holohan. McGregor’s posts indicate they were rounds spent rolling jiu-jitsu, something McGregor had to abandon in his Marquess of Queensberry ruled boxing match with Floyd.\n\nWith many MMA pundits and fans alike calling for McGregor to “Defend or Vacate” his UFC Lightweight Championship or fight against now interim champion Tony Ferguson, this is certainly a glimmer of hope to their request. However, McGregor revealed recently in a Twitter post that the UFC brass needed to do quite a lot to get him back into the cage.\n\nDana White recently stated in an interview with Yahoo! Sports that if Conor isn’t slated to defend his strap by March, then the UFC would book Tony Ferguson vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov for the real 155-pound title.\n\n    “As long as Conor is willing to fight by March, we could do Khabib versus Tony and then the winner fights Conor for the title. Or, if Conor wants to sit out until next fall, then we’d have to make Khabib versus Tony for the title, not the interim title.”\n    Dana White\n\nOnly time will tell how this plays out, but one thing is for sure, many people would like to see Conor McGregor back inside the Octagon in 2018."], ["published_date", "January 8, 2018"], ["link", "https://thebodylockmma.com/ufc/will-conor-mcgregor-return-ufcs-octagon-2018/"], ["created_at", "2018-10-26 02:23:52.271625"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-26 02:23:52.271625"]]

The question is, which Uriah Hall will show up? Will it be the Hall who dropped jaws all around the world with his spinning wheelhouse kick KO of Adam Cella, or will it be the Hall who got stopped in the first round against Derek Brunson and Gegard Mousasi?\n\nUriah Hall is as infamous for his inconsistency against top-tier opponents as he is for his KO of Cella during The Ultimate Fighter Season 17. Since that highlight-reel kick that put Uriah Hall on the map, it’s been an up and down career for the 33 year old from Jamaica.\n\nWith his biggest win coming as a heavy underdog against Gegard Mousasi via impressive TKO back in September 2015, Hall has since lost to the likes of Robert Whitaker, Derek Brunson, and Gegard Mousasi in their latter scheduled rematch.\n\nHowever, Uriah had a strong rebound showing in his latest contest, snagging a very impressive come from behind TKO victory over #13 ranked Krzysztof Jotko in September.\n\nHall is an explosive striker, who uses great angles and surprises opponents with his spinning attacks very well. With a chance here to prove he belongs in the top 10 of the talent stacked 185-pound division, even against a declining Vitor Belfort, Uriah is in a do or die position in his career.\nBack against the wall\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time though Uriah has had his back against the wall. In a similar position back in December of 2013, Hall defeated Chris Leben after Dana White stated “Uriah Hall will be leaving town if he doesn’t beat Chris Leben at UFC 168.”\n\nWith Vitor Belfort being 1-2-1 in his last four fights, and speculation of his imminent retirement soon, Belfort will surely be looking to leave the sport the same way he came in, with an impact.\n\nUriah Hall faces one of the biggest challenges of his career this Sunday against a prolific legend, but with his back against the wall, he’s looking at this opportunity as sign he’s finally made it, and is more ready then ever to step inside the cage."], ["published_date", "January 13, 2018"], ["link", "https://thebodylockmma.com/ufc/do-or-die-uriah-hall-ufc-fight-night-124/"], ["created_at", "2018-10-26 03:07:34.627428"], ["updated_at", "2018-10-26 03:07:34.627428"]]

ActionController::UnknownFormat (PostsController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
